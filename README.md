# Unrelenting Rain

![Untitled-3_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54951411/226438669-f305a246-db03-445a-9a28-3bc92b0b8688.gif)

Next to Shoryn's family's house, there exists a lake. But not just any old lake. This was a lake that was so consistently shallow that it only went up to the ankles wherever you stood on the lake. Yet the lake itself almost seemed boundless in diameter from Shoryn's house, turning into mist over the horizon. Its surface is the perfect image of stillness. It reflects the sun and clouds like a mirror.

It was a Saturday, a beautiful one where the skies were completely blue and the clouds lazy nimbuses that, made the lake strikingly beautiful. Shoryn stands on the slope leading down to the lake. Out in the distance today, she makes out a tiny island where a small speck of land was peaking out from near the center of the lake. 

Shoryn looks back up the hill, and sees that her parents and brother are nowhere to be found.

Shoryn takes a step into the lake, barefoot. She feels the warmth of the ovular rocks taking in the sun, yet itself is contrasted sharply with the cool water of the lake. A lazy, serene ripple emanates from her feet across the surface of the still water. She keeps on walking foward. The wind was just there, enough to move through her hair, but not enough to disturb the calm of the water. She took each step gingerly and slowly. Each step makes a ripple with a far spanning diameter, travelling at high speed first then slowly petering out in thickness near the edge 

Finally, Shoryn arrives at the lake. There, stretched across the edge of the short promontory is a small knife. Shoryn sits down at the small island, and begins to gather small stones. She seeks to find rocks as round as possible, and measures them to be about the size of her pinky. 

Finally, when Shoryn gathered enough rocks, she takes a piece of rock, holds it as high above her head in front of her as she can, then drops the rock into the water. The water first reacts with an initial ripple to the rock, then from the depth of the water rises a reactionary water droplet. As if waiting for that droplet to appear, Shoryn swings the knife in her hand toward the droplet. The two collide, and water flies everywhere in a sprinkle. Shoryn sighs, then waits for the ripples to die out.

Shoryn then takes a second pebble. She holds it high above her head once again, then drops the pebble. Whish. The knife cuts too early this time and instead the knife passes through thin air. 

Shoryn gets visibly frustrated, and her face turns into a grimace. Then she calms down and takes a deep breath. 

The third pebble. She holds it high above her head, drops it. Waits for the reactive bubble of water to come up. Swings. But is too late again this time, slicing the sphere in two. 

She tries a fourth, fifth time.

On some unknown try, when Shoryn swings her knife, the knife cups the drop of water above it, and the water water droplet doesn't fall, but instead hangs on top of the knife.

Shoryn puts this water droplet on her left index finger, flips it to her right, then grabs the pebble and holds it into the sky. It's a perfect sphere, yet one that stays in its own shape. She takes the pebble, and puts it to her right, which is the base of a growing tetrahedron.

"Shoryn!" A cry resounds from the far shore. Shoryn stays silent. "Shoryn, get back,, it's time for dinner!"   
  
"Father wait, I'm almost finished!"  

"What are you doing Shoryn, in the middle of that lake? I'm coming over now."   
  
Father begins to take heavy, steps on the lake. Waves spread from his foot like massive waves, bouncing off the shore and crashing into the surface of the lake. Once father reaches the shore, the waves hit the pile of Shoryn's tetrahedron, half of which dissolve on contact with the wwater.  
  
Shoryn stares in consternation.   
  
Father towers over her. "Shoryn, get back home. Can you believe your brother's cooking dinner right now?" He stares at the pile of bubbles, now splayed all over the place, some bursted. "What's this?"   
  
"I've been making a tetrahderon, out of water beads. Don't you see, how pretty it is? She stares hopefully at him.   
  
He takes one look at the beads, then says  
"It's looking pretty disarrayed to me. And haven't I told you lately that I want to see you reading?"   
  
"But, I love making these structures."  

"NO. no you don't. come back before your mom gets angrier"   

Shoryn bites her lip. The scene cuts to the character's feet, where a slow cascade of ripples falls from Shoryn's face while the father walks back.   
  
The beads are left untouched around the lake.

The moment that Shoryn opens the door, she sees her brother and mother scrambling around. Her brother stands at the kitchen, whisking eggs around a giant wok that sits on top of a fiery campstove. He's conversing with his mother, who is dutifully answering his every question. Her father sits at the dining table reading a book.   

Shoryn wipes off her tears and asks her mother, 

"Can I help?" 

"Sure," her mother replies, "wash the dishes in the sink for me" Then gets down to business washing things, noting how the water is in constant flow from the sink.   

"Brother, take a look at this:" She takes a spoon that she was meant to wash and places it under the sink of flowing water. Shoryn fumbles with the sink for a while, adjusting the amount of water going onto the spoon. Finally, at some medium level of water output, the water colliding with the spoon made a small smooth circle with curled edges. Her brother, who has taken a break from his cooking duties, stares wonderfully at the spectacle. Then with a quick movement of her hands she grabs the water and the water moved from the spoon and into a floating, spinning round piece of fabric, in her hands instead of on the spoon. Her brother stars amazed as she holds it over his head and releases it over his head. The circle floats slowly down over his and pops into pure water on his hair. "Hey, I'll get you back for that!" Her brother says playfully as he reaches in the sink to grab another spoon.

Shoryn's family table was a marvel of engineering. The seats fashioned from water membranes, little round spheres that were comfortable to sit in. And the table itself was a double-revolving lily pad that floated sturdily above a pool of water.
Her mother continues to cook as the kids play.   
  
As they enjoy their dinner, mother makes conversation exclusively with father for the first few minutes, while the children enjoy their Shoryn's their small amounts. 

Seeing how Shoryn only has veggies in her bowl, mother rotates the meat over to Shoryn by turning the lily pad.
  
"Eat these Shoryn, sweet pork will make you beautiful"  
Shoryn reluctantly takes some meat from her bowl. 
Then her mother rotates the lily pad until the pork bowl faced her brother.
"And meat will make you strong, dear"

Surprisingly, the meat is good, and their meal continues.  Shoryn talks with her brother, and they laugh all night long.

Sunday. The rain came down in a torrential downpoour. The surface of the lake ripples with rain (how deep does the water go?).

Shoryn sits at the dinner table, staring out the dining room window to see the lake as its normally clear surface is punctuated by dozens of rain droplets. 

Above her hangs a chandelier made with water string, holding a gem that radiates light. Tonight she could not weave more beads at the lake. Nature simply forbid it. Her mom worked right next to the kitchen as well, as her dad was off to work. 

Shoryn was doing her math homework today, in preparation for her eighth grade school tomorrow, which would be in the village school that everyone in the village went to. 

Shoryn ultimately liked math, because although learning new math was always difficult, it provided her ease in being able to solve math problems. Incidentally, the problem today was talking about the area of a sphere. She didn't understand though, why this formula came to be. She didn't have any intuition for it. 

After 30 minutes past, work was getting extremely tedious on the math problems, which were extremely repetitive in nature, so she took a swig of water from her cup, then set it down violently. Her lily pad table shook and almost buckled with swaying. getting water all over her homework. 

But what caught her attention wasn't that. It was the ripples underneath it all. The ripple in the cup. She ripped a corner off her wet paper, scrunched it into a ball, and dropped it into the cup. But the resulting reverberations were too messy, too unpredictable to make anything out of. 

So she turned her attention to the table. She shifted the lily pad over and dropped another ball of her homework into the pool to generate a water droplet. This time, a rebounding water droplet flies up to the surface. But what to swipe it with? She grabs a ruler in her pencil pouch to try to catch the water droplet. For each droplet, she lines them up in a row on the table.

Finally, she puts the unused part of her paper on the lily pad, and grasps the ripple wavefront with her hands. She gets frustrated at first, but then takes a deep breath. It takes her many, many tries to finally get a water string. She ties the water strings together with the beads, but the bracelet falls into the pool. She reaches quickly to grab it, but sloshes the table. 

Suddenly her cup slipped and homework, pen, and paper all went into the pool. 

Her mom hears the slash, and comes over from the kitchen to see her cutlery and Shoryn's homework all soaked and some at the bottom of the table.

"Shoryn, what is this??"

"...I made this bracelet for you..." Shoryn showed mother the bracelets she made, a beautifully crafted beaded bracelet with 3 beads. Mother takes the bracelets and whips it toward the wall, unraveling the bracelet and splattering the beads on the wall. "What kind of daughter are you?? Doesn't do homework and just plays all day!"

Shoryn's eyes start to well up. She flings open the door, and runs outside.

She could only think of the lake, and that one island in the center. The lake, which usually tickled her ankles, now rose slightly under her calves, causing her to slosh and stumble around the water in her journey to find the island. But the shore was nowhere to be found.

Shoryn stayed out there on the lake, crying, struggling to hold her tears in, but they wouldn't stop coming out. Each tear drop that fell from her face was hidden underneath the torrential rain. When she cried, she hoped that her parents would come comfort her. To show her some love. But she knew as well that her parents firmly held the view that she should not pursue this art. She was torn there, stuck wondering what she would do.

Dad calls her name. "Shoryn! Shoryn! Please, come back!" But Shoryn doesn't respond. 

Eventually Dad comes with a robe and an umbrella, slings the robe over Shoryn and hangs the umbrella over her. 

"Shoryn, let's get back inside. Shoryn." But Shoryn still doesn't respond. 

They wait until the rain stops, the full moon and the stars come out. Shoryn couldn't distinguish the reflected parts of the sky from the sky itself. The ground was alive.

"It's beautiful. My goodness."

"Beauty, huh?" Shoryn takes in a deep breath. "Dad. The other day, you broke the tetrahedron I was working on..."
